## How to Use Guide: Stock Charting and Technical Analysis App

### Introduction
Welcome to the Stock Charting and Technical Analysis App! This tool is designed to provide traders with valuable insights into stock price movements and potential trading opportunities. In this guide, we'll walk you through the various technical indicators and information available in the app, along with explanations on how to interpret them.

### Technical Indicators
1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:
   - **Description**: SMA calculates the average closing price of a stock over a specified time period. It is used to identify trends and potential support or resistance levels.
   - **Interpretation**: When the current price crosses above the SMA, it may indicate a bullish trend, while a cross below the SMA may suggest a bearish trend.

2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
   - **Description**: EMA is similar to SMA but places more weight on recent price data, making it more responsive to price changes.
   - **Interpretation**: Similar to SMA, crossovers between the price and EMA can signal trend changes.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - **Description**: RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.
   - **Interpretation**: RSI values above 70 indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal to the downside. Conversely, RSI values below 30 indicate oversold conditions, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.

### Additional Information
1. **Candlestick Chart**:
   - **Description**: Candlestick charts display the open, high, low, and close prices of a stock within a specified time period.
   - **Interpretation**: Bullish candlesticks (green or white) indicate buying pressure, while bearish candlesticks (red or black) indicate selling pressure. Patterns such as hammers, dojis, and engulfing patterns can provide insights into market sentiment.

2. **Volume Analysis**:
   - **Description**: Volume represents the number of shares traded during a specific time period.
   - **Interpretation**: High volume during price advances suggests strong buying interest, confirming bullish trends. Conversely, high volume during price declines confirms bearish trends.

3. **Support and Resistance Levels**:
   - **Description**: Support levels are price levels where a stock tends to find buying interest, preventing it from falling further. Resistance levels are price levels where a stock tends to encounter selling pressure, preventing it from rising further.
   - **Interpretation**: Breakouts above resistance levels or bounces off support levels can signal potential trading opportunities.

4. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**:
   - **Description**: Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate potential areas of support or resistance based on Fibonacci ratios.
   - **Interpretation**: Traders use Fibonacci retracement levels to identify potential reversal points during market corrections.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Description**: The app provides information on high volume options for the selected stock, including expiration dates, strike prices, and option types (calls or puts).
   - **Interpretation**: High volume options activity can indicate areas of interest for market participants, potentially signaling future price movements.
