## Understanding and Using Technical Indicators

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

- **SMA** smooths out price data to identify trends.
- **Usage**: Crosses above the SMA indicate potential buy signals; crosses below indicate potential sell signals.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

- **EMA** reacts more quickly to price changes compared to SMA.
- **Usage**: Similar to SMA but offers more timely signals.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

- **RSI** measures the speed and change of price movements.
- **Usage**: Values above 70 suggest overbought conditions (potential sell), and values below 30 suggest oversold conditions (potential buy).

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

- **MACD** shows the relationship between two EMAs.
- **Usage**: MACD crossing above the signal line can indicate a buy signal, while crossing below can indicate a sell signal.

### Bollinger Bands (BBands)

- **BBands** consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations from the SMA).
- **Usage**: Price touching the upper band suggests overbought conditions, and touching the lower band suggests oversold conditions.

### Ichimoku Cloud

- **Ichimoku Cloud** provides support and resistance levels and trend direction.
- **Usage**: Price above the cloud suggests an uptrend, below suggests a downtrend. The cloud itself indicates support and resistance levels.

### Stochastic Oscillator

- **Stochastic Oscillator** compares a specific closing price to a range of prices over time.
- **Usage**: Values above 80 are overbought (potential sell), and values below 20 are oversold (potential buy). Crossovers signal buy/sell opportunities.

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

- **OBV** measures cumulative buying and selling pressure.
- **Usage**: Rising OBV suggests buying pressure (potential buy), falling OBV suggests selling pressure (potential sell).

### Parabolic SAR

- **Parabolic SAR** provides potential entry and exit points.
- **Usage**: When the price is below the SAR, it suggests a sell signal; when above, it suggests a buy signal.
